    <p>This article will show you how to set up the PT100 Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD) with the <strong>MAX31865</strong> Sensor Amplifier.</p>
<h1 id="basic-principles">Basic Principles</h1>
<p>RTDs contain a resistor that changes its resistance as the temperature flucuates. In the PT100, the resistor is a small strip of platinum, which will have a resistance of 100 ohms at 0 degrees celsius, which explains the name. Adafruit has a PT1000 that will have a resistance of 1000 ohms at 0 degrees C. The difference between the two is accuracy, since the same change in tempereature will cause a larger change in resistance on the PT1000, it will be more accurate. However, Platinum RTD&rsquo;s are inherently accurate so saving a few dollars by getting the PT100 will have little affect for most projects.</p>
<p>If we just attached our RTD to an Arduino, we wouldn&rsquo;t have a good way to measure the changes. Therefore, we need an amplifier to get the best accurary out of the probe. Adafruit&rsquo;s MAX31865 will not only amplify the signal, but also regulate other factors that go a bit beyond the scope of this article. Some RTD&rsquo;s also have more that the two wires that help account for lost voltage and improve accuracy; the one in the article has 3 wires, and the MAX amplifier can make use of this. To talk to the Arduino, the board uses the standard serial peripheral interface (SPI) and can be powered with 3V-5V, and can provide 3.3V for up to 100 mA as well.</p>

<p>The actual MAX31865 chip is a tiny integrated circuit while the board contains all the other components necessary to make it function. It also has several pins that make connecting to the board simple.</p>
<p><strong>Power Pins</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vin: The chips need 3V DC to operate, but an onboard voltage regulator allows up to 5V to allow common 5V microcontrollers (Arduinos) to connected smoothly.</li>
<li>GND: The common ground pin</li>
<li>3V3: This ouputs 3.3V and up to 100mA of current to be drawn. Not needed for basic temperature sensing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SPI Logic Pins</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CLK: The <em>clock</em> pin for SPI</li>
<li>SDO: <strong>S</strong>erial <strong>D</strong>ata <strong>O</strong>ut, also known as Microcontroller In Sensor Out, used for data sent from the <em>MAX</em> to the <em>Arduino</em></li>
<li>SDI: <strong>S</strong>erial <strong>D</strong>ata <strong>I</strong>n, also known as Microcontroller Out Sensor In, used for data sent from the <em>Arduino</em> to the <em>MAX</em></li>
<li>CS: <strong>C</strong>hip <strong>S</strong>elect, when low the MAX chip is active</li>
</ul>
<p>Connecting multiple MAX31865&rsquo;s or other SPI devices? Have them share a CLK, SDO, and SDI pins but keep seperate CS pins and only activate one chip at a time.</p>
<ul>
<li>RDY: the data-<strong>ready</strong> indicator pin, can be used to speed up reads for custom drivers. Adafruit&rsquo;s Arduino library doesn&rsquo;t make use of this pin.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are <em>four</em> contacts that connect the RTD sensors to the board. All contacts don&rsquo;t need to be used since the board supports 2, 3, or 4 wire sensors. Additionally, the 3 and 4 wire sensor can be used as a 3 or 2 wire sensor by not connecting the extra wires, only sacrificing a little accurary.</p>

By default the board is set up for the 4 wire sensor, but the 2 and 3 wire set up only requires a little soldering.</p>
<p><strong>3-wire</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Solder closed the jumper labeled <strong>2/3 Wire</strong></li>
<li>Leave jumper labeled <strong>2 Wire</strong> untouched</li>
<li>Cut the small tab in between the <em>2</em> and <em>4</em> on the last jumper, then solder the rigthmost and middle pads closed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips for 3 pad jumper:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cutting the tab can be difficult and does scratch the surrounding area slightly so just be mindful</li>
<li>Use a small amount of solder when connecting the middle and right pads and have a solder sucker ready in case the left pad accidentely gets connected</li>
<li>My first time trying to get the solder to lay correctly took quite a bit of trial and error, but just be careful to not overheat the chip</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2-wire</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Solder closed the jumper labeled <strong>2/3 Wire</strong></li>
<li>solder closed the jumper labeled <strong>2 Wire</strong></li>
<li>Leave the 3 pad jumper untouched</li>
</ul>
